# Track-Items-Website
This is a group web project that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript in Express and a json file to store data that tracks items over 
a certain duration of years. The user can input their products and the prices on various years and a line graph will be plotted 
to show the pattern. They can also edit or delete the products in the front-end. It's a one page website used to learn the basics 
of Express and servers. It was developed by Trev, Joel, Minna and me while taking the Advanced Web Development class.
